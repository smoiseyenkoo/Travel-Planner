# My Personal Project
## Travel Planner

The project that I want to design this term is a travel planner. 
The application would have destinations, which would include a *string* City and
a *string* Country, a *method of travel* (train, plane, bus), and an *integer* of 
travel costs. The user would be able would be able to add a destination to 
a **list of cities already visited**, to a **list of cities planned to visit**,
or to a **wishlist of destination they would like to travel to**. 

Anyone who wishes to travel with organization and a cool itinerary would 
want to use this application. Being able to track the places that one has
already been to, places they will go to, and projected travel costs, as well
as keeping track of money already spent allows for easier budgeting in 
one's endeavours, to maximize the time spent enjoying travel, and minimizing
the headache of trying to keep track of all travel factors.

This topic is of interest to me as I have never really traveled much, 
however I am planning to do a long multi-country trip by myself next year,
and having a planned itinerary and a way to track my budget seems very
useful.
